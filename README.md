This project is an extension of work done by Allen Dai in 2022:

https://github.com/allendai1/cs460student/tree/main/axo

Our goal is to create an application that will help the McCusker lab at the
University of Massachusetts in Boston better analyze the regerative properties
of the Axolotl. The original software allows for viewing scans of the animals
at a high resolution and measuring the length (in pixels) between two points on
the image. Our goal is to improve the interface by getting the actual 
measurements based on the scale of the image, and allowing for this data to be
saved.
