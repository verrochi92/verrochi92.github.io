            <h1>Hello, World!</h1>
            <p>
                Welcome to personal home page! My name is Nicholas Verrochi and I'm a first-generation college
                student studing at the University of Massachusetts in Boston, and an incoming junior software
                development engineer at Publicis Sapient. I love coding and math, and I'm always looking to
                learn more and try new things! I mostly do backend Java coding, but I'm well-versed in Python,
                C/++, and Javascript. I specialize in web and mobile apps as well as database design. 
                If you want to collaborate on a cool software idea, want help with software development, or just 
                want to network, please email me at <a href="mailto:verrochi92@gmail.com">verrochi92@gmail.com</a>. 
                Feel free to use any of my code for any cool ideas you have, just give me credit and let me check
                out what you're working on!

            <p>
                This project I did as my capstone at UMass. Our goal was to create software that could
                be used to take measurements from scans of Axolotls to help the McCusker lab study their
                regenerative properties. We used two Javascript libraries, OpenSeadragon and Fabric.js.
                This was a team project, but I wrote the majority of the code.
